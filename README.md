# Palindrome-Checker
The Palindrome Checker verifies if a word or phrase reads the same backward as forward, like "madam" or "racecar." It removes spaces, ignores case, and checks for symmetry. Users input a text, click a button, and instantly see the result, making it a simple yet effective tool for learning string manipulation and logical thinking.
